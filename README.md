# iris-classification
This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements. Using the Iris dataset and algorithms like SVM and KNN, the model achieves high accuracy and demonstrates a simple, effective classification system.
